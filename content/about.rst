About Us
********

Microscope is a free and open source software project aiming to provide
a native Python interface to microscope devices independent of hardware
specifics.

History
=======

Development of Microscope started in 2016 at the University of Oxford
`Micron Bioimaging Unit <https://www.micron.ox.ac.uk>`_.  Development
was initially guided to support development of a new version of `Cockpit
<https://www.micron.ox.ac.uk/software/cockpit/>`_, a graphical user
interface for the control of bespoke microscopes.


Funding
=======

Development of Microscope at Micron was supported by the Wellcome
Trust Strategic Award 107457/Z/15/Z to Prof. Ilan Davis between 2016
and 2021.
